A Web application of mapping the locations of DUI (Driving under the influence) providers in CA
===

If you are the offender of DUI (Driving under the influence) in CA, you need to attend one of DUI programs. California Department of Human Service already provides a directory of DUI providers on its website (http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/individuals/Pages/ProviderDirectory-DUI.aspx). But, it is PDF file and may be time-consuming to find an appropriate one. 

HDMA collaborates with Prof. Sheldon Wong (SDSU) and California Department of Human Service to create a Web application to visualize and map DUI providers in CA. Users can directly go to http://vision.sdsu.edu/dui/ to check and search a DUI providers.

The Web application is powered by jQuery, Bootstrap, leaflet API, and Google Fusion Table.
